# Garmin Alarm Clock App

This is a Monkey C project for a Garmin alarm clock app designed to operate based on sleep data collected by Garmin devices. The app allows users to set alarms that wake them up at an optimal time based on their sleep patterns, helping them feel more refreshed and energized in the morning.

## Features

- **Optimal Wake-Up Time:** Utilizes sleep data collected by Garmin devices to determine the user's sleep patterns and set alarms to wake them up at the most suitable time within a specified time window.
- **Customizable Alarms:** Users can customize alarm settings such as alarm time, snooze duration, and alarm tone to suit their preferences.
- **Snooze Functionality:** Includes a snooze option for users who want to catch a few extra minutes of sleep before waking up fully.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Simple and intuitive user interface optimized for Garmin devices, making it easy for users to set alarms and navigate the app.

## Requirements

- Garmin Connect IQ SDK: The app is built using the Garmin Connect IQ SDK, which provides the necessary tools and libraries for developing apps for Garmin devices.
- Monkey C Programming Knowledge: Familiarity with Monkey C programming language is required for developing and customizing the app.
- Compatible Garmin Device: The app is designed to run on compatible Garmin devices equipped with sleep tracking capabilities.
